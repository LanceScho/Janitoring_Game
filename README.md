You will see this in the intro but it's here too:
W Key = Mop - Use to clean the greenish bricks
A Key = Broom - Use on purple carpet tiles to clean them
S Key = Trash Bags - Use on small objects to clean them up. (Rubble, Bowls, and skulls are small objects)
D Key = Hammer - Use to break down massive trash that can then becomes rubble which can be bagged. (Chandelier, Chairs, Skeletons)
Arrow Key - Movement (The Janitor wraps around the screen by the way!)

My goals were the following:
- Make a top down tile based game
- Make all of my own art
- Have my base game work solidly


List of techniques:
- Objects
- 2D data structures
- A ton of conditions
- Collison detection
- Constant Updating

I learned a lot from this project! I can't belive that I was the one who made this! I am very proud of myself, and glad that I've learned this much in just one semester
I got really stuck when it came to level progression. At first I was stuck on getting the game to go from level 1 to level 2, and once i figured that out I thought that getting from level 1 to level 3 would be easy, BUT IT WAS ALSO A REAL PAIN. But I got it!
My code is still pretty messy, so I need to clean it up and make it a little less confusing.

I staryed from my game design document only when I realized that the way I was mapping out levels 2 and 3 was not very efficeint.
And I stayed on track when it came to me being like, "The hammer will make tiles go from state 9, to 8" and that sort of stuff.
